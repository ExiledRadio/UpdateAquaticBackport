/**
 * A stripped log or stripped wood, 1.14's {@code stripped_<wood>_log} and {@code stripped_<wood>_wood}.
 *
 * <h2>A log, as far as anything else can tell</h2>
 * Both extend vanilla's {@link BlockLog}, so they are wood to every check that asks - leaves next to
 * one do not decay ({@code canSustainLeaves}), tree-felling and lumber mods that look for
 * {@code instanceof BlockLog} or {@code isWood} treat them as logs, and placement, rotation in
 * structures and leaf decay on breaking all come from the same code as an oak log's. 1.14 counts
 * stripped logs as logs too: they are in its {@code logs} tag.
 *
 * <h2>One property, the same as a log's</h2>
 * {@link BlockLog#LOG_AXIS}, named {@code axis} and spelled {@code x}, {@code y}, {@code z} like 1.14's,
 * so a structure file's {@code axis=x} carries straight across. Its fourth value, {@code none}, is how
 * 1.12.2 draws bark on all six faces; here it draws a stripped log as stripped wood. Nothing in survival
 * reaches it (placing sets the axis from the face clicked, and stripping vanilla's bark gives the
 * stripped wood block); it is only there because the property has it.
 *
 * <h2>Stripped wood has an axis too</h2>
 * As in 1.14 and Future MC. All six faces show the same texture so it changes nothing you can see,
 * but a village's {@code stripped_spruce_wood[axis=x]} keeps its axis, and Future MC's twin takes it
 * by name.
 *
 * <h2>Not bark</h2>
 * 1.14's unstripped {@code oak_wood} is not added: 1.12.2 already has it as a vanilla log with
 * {@code axis=none}, which is what this mod's structures place for it.
