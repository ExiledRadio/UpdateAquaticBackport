/**
 * 1.14's trapdoor, button and pressure plate in the five woods that are not oak.
 *
 * <h2>Vanilla's own blocks, in another wood</h2>
 * Each is a subclass of the exact vanilla class the oak one is, built with the oak one's material,
 * hardness, sound and sensitivity (see {@code Block.registerBlocks}). So opening, closing, the
 * redstone signal, how long a button stays pressed, what a pressure plate counts, which sound each
 * plays, a trapdoor over a ladder being climbable, and pistons breaking them, are all vanilla's own
 * code and cannot drift from the oak ones. The only thing each changes is its map color, which 1.14
 * takes from the planks.
 *
 * <h2>Why three classes in one file</h2>
 * Their constructors are protected, so each needs a subclass to exist at all, and none of them needs
 * more than a constructor and a color.
